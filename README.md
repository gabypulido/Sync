Contributions:

  Maria Maynard:
  
  - Signup screen with email sign up using firebase.
   
  - Social media opt in screen with place holders for social media login.
  
  Gabriela Pulido:
   - Notification Hub table view with notification placeholders.
   - Twitter Channel table view.
   - Instagram Channel table view.
   - LinkedIn Channel table view.
   - Facebook Channel table view.
   
  Ji-Young Seo:

   - Log in screen that authenticates using firebase.
   
  

Differences:
  - In  our proposal we stated that there would be only an "admin login" in our alpha release. This was before we knew how to authenticate users using firebase, so we went ahead and set up a normal login system with no admin account.
